Thank you for checking out my game!

Here's a quick rundown of the controls:

You move the summoner with WASD
You summon a jinn with SPACE
When a jinn is summoned, you can control the jinn with the arrow keys.
When a jinn is not summoned, the arrow keys shoot arrows from the summoner.
When a jinn is summoned, you can use the arrow keys to run into objects with the jinn. This will posess the objects!
While posessing an object, you can press Q to use that object. Every object has a unique usage! Objects that can move are moved using the arrow keys.
You can press SPACE again to unsummon the jinn. You have a limited amount of mana, so be careful!

Enjoy!
